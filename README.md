# S3AD

We release a **road-scene 3D anomaly object detection dataset** based on **augmented reality**.  
The dataset consists of two subsets:

- **Auxiliary Training Set**: contains multi-scale distributions composed of common object types.
- **OoD Evaluation Set**: composed of rare and unknown categories for out-of-distribution evaluation.

The ground truth annotations strictly follow the format of the **KITTI 3D Object Detection** dataset.

Details of the synthesis process and evaluation baselines can be found in our paper:  
**_Stereo-based 3D Anomaly Object Detection for Autonomous Driving: A New Dataset and Baseline_**.(Under Review)

Baseline code is coming soon.
